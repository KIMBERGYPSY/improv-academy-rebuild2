Project Title: Website Redesign of https://computercoach.com/

Description: We have been charged with creating a beautiful new website for a tech academy called Computer Coach. Using Version Control + Advanced CSS  | Academy Website Analysis + Development. We built this project to help give users who will visit Computer Coach's website a more interactive experience. We wanted them to get a feel of a tech company, so they can get an idea of what type of work they can expect to do. We also wanted users to find information easier and simpler. That way they do not have to go through to many steps. Which could cause the user to get frustrated and then have them leave the site. So that potential students can see who they might encounter while taking part in the program, we added a meet the team section. To showcase that graduating is possible, we decided to implement an alumni section.

How to use: Once you open the website, there will be a navigation bar where you can click to view the different course options available. You can find Computer's Coach phone number to call them or if you would prefer to have someone reach out via email you can click the request info button. You scroll down a little bit you can find the apply now bottom. Scroll a little and then you can find Computer coaches partnerships. Scroll down and underneath  the hiring partners, you will find an image that talks slightly about the schedules that are offered at Computer Coach. 

Technologies: Figma, VS code, Netlify, Github and Code sandbox were used to create our website

Whether through advertising, public relations, or web development, I’m excited to build brands and entice audiences with targeted communications. I have always been interested in technology and creating projects within those industries, which is why I’ve pursued a recent interest in front-end development and digital marketing. I’m a graduate of the University of South Florida, where I majored in Mass Communications with a focus in Advertising and Public Relations. I also obtained a minor in Public Administration. Recently, I completed a Frontend Development Apprenticeship Program through Career Source and Computer Coach, which connected me with Minitry, an event marketing agency.

Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit. I recently was a student in the Career Source and Computer Coach Apprenticeship Program, where I gained advanced experience in front-end web development. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science, but am willing to gain more insight into the web development field. For this reason, I am seeking a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers. In return, I will offer my full accountability, and be a pleasant addition.
