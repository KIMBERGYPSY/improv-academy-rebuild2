Whether through advertising, public relations, or web development, I’m excited to build brands and entice audiences with targeted communications. I have always been interested in technology and creating projects within those industries, which is why I’ve pursued a recent interest in front-end development and digital marketing. I’m a graduate of the University of South Florida, where I majored in Mass Communications with a focus in Advertising and Public Relations. I also obtained a minor in Public Administration. Recently, I completed a Frontend Development Apprenticeship Program through Career Source and Computer Coach, which connected me with Minitry, an event marketing agency.

Jayvias Campbell
Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit. I recently was a student in the Career Source and Computer Coach Apprenticeship Program, where I gained advanced experience in front-end web development. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science, but am willing to gain more insight into the web development field. For this reason, I am seeking a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers. In return, I will offer my full accountability, and be a pleasant addition.
